My work in macro-labor examines how habits, expectations, beliefs, and learning influence unemployment dynamics at both the micro and macro levels. My more recent environmental research focuses on the determinants of beliefs about environmental issues and the role of technology in reshaping the natural world. I have also worked on labor antitrust policy, trade, intergenerational wealth transmission, and bias in media coverage.</p>

                                    This paper studies how local air pollution affects public demand for government spending on environmental protection. I merge daily air quality data from thousands of EPA monitoring stations with restricted-use county identifiers from the General Social Survey (GSS) to study two distinct channels: direct physical exposure to pollution and informational shocks from air quality advisories. I distinguish immediate effects of pollution from lagged effects one month later to assess the durability of demand responses. I document three main results: (i) Recent exposure to elevated PM10 concentrations increases the probability that respondents support more government spending on environmental protection, but this effect vanishes within one month; (ii) exposure to PM2.5 and ozone have no effect on support for environmental spending; and (iii) exploiting discontinuities around EPA advisory thresholds, when conditions deteriorate from “Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups” to “Unhealthy,” support for environmental spending rises sharply, yet again the effect vanishes within one month. These findings suggest that deteriorating air quality has at most a transient effect on demand for fiscal outlays on the environment, underscoring the limits of endogenous public support for programs aimed at mitigating and adapting to climate change.</p>

                                    Global forest cover was in steady decline for millennia prior modern industrialization. This paper studies how technological progress in agriculture shaped long-run forest cover in pre-industrial societies. I begin by developing an equilibrium bio-economic model to analyze how agricultural productivity influenced land allocation decisions and forest cover in the presence of limited trade and Malthusian population dynamics. I show that while early agricultural innovations may have spared forests, beyond a threshold further advances necessarily expand cultivation and accelerate deforestation. I test these predictions using high-resolution Holocene forest reconstructions from fossil pollen data. Exploiting variation in the timing of the First Agricultural Revolution, I find that early adoption led to a sustained 25% per-millennium decline in forest cover relative to later adopters. In a complementary case study focusing on the introduction of the three-field rotation system in medieval Europe, I show that the system caused an immediate 20% reduction in forest cover followed by a long-run decline of 50%. Together, these results indicate that agricultural innovation was an important driver of global deforestation in the pre-industrial era.

                                <p>Modern job search technologies enable job seekers to monitor the arrival of newly posted vacancies. This paper conceptualizes search as a monitoring decision and shows that monitoring technologies give rise to a novel source of strategic complementarities in search and can thus lead to potentially destabilizing multiplicity of equilibria. The model provides a theory of belief-driven fluctuations in labor supply that can permanently shift the path of the economy, and offers an explanation for persistently weak wage growth despite low unemployment during the recovery from the Great Recession.</p>

                                <p>We study the efficiency of non-compete agreements (NCAs) in an equilibrium model of labour turnover. The model is consistent with empirical studies showing that NCAs reduce turnover and average wages for low-wage workers. The model also predicts that, by reducing turnover, NCAs raise recruitment and employment. We show that optimal NCA policy: (i) is characterized by a Hosios-like condition that balances the benefits of higher employment against the costs of inefficient congestion and poaching; (ii) depends critically on the minimum wage; and (iii) alone cannot always achieve the constrained-efficient allocation—a result that also holds for optimal minimum wage policy—yet with both policies, efficiency is always attainable. To guide policymakers, we derive a sufficient statistic in the form of an easily computed employment threshold above which NCAs are necessarily inefficiently restrictive, and show that employment levels in current low-wage US labour markets typically exceed this threshold. Finally, we calibrate the model and show that Oregon's 2008 NCA ban for low-wage workers increased welfare modestly (by roughly 0.1%), and that if policymakers had also raised the minimum wage to its optimal level conditional on the enacted NCA ban (a 30% increase), then welfare would have increased more substantially—by over 1%.</p>

                                <p>We identify the main shock driving fluctuations in long-horizon productivity expectations, consistent with theories of TFP news. The identified shock induces strong comovement patterns in output, consumption, investment, employment, and stock prices even though TFP does not change significantly for more than 2 years. A labor search model in which wages are determined by a cash-flow sharing rule, rather than the present value of match surplus, matches the observed responses to the news shock. The model also matches the empirical patterns of vacancies, labor force participation, hours, and job-finding rates. The proposed wage rule is consistent with empirical responses of wages to both anticipated and unanticipated productivity changes.</p>

Drawing on insights from the consumption-habit literature, I use a model of intertemporal time allocation to derive a test for habit-formation in leisure activities. The data reveal strong evidence of habit-formation in LIU among the Generation-X age cohort. With the exception of reading, I find no evidence of habit-formation in offline leisure.</p>

                                <p>We study the wage-setting problem of an employer with private information about demand for its product when workers can engage in costly on-the-job search. Employers understand that low wage offers may convey bad news that induces workers to search. The unique perfect sequential equilibrium wage strategy is characterized by: (i) pooling by intermediate-revenue employers on a common wage that just deters search, (ii) discontinuously lower revealing offers by low-revenue employers for whom the benefit of deterring search fails to warrant the required high pooling wage and (iii) high revealing offers by high-revenue employers seeking to deter aggressive raiders.</p>

                                <p>Krueger and Mueller (2011) document that search effort declined with unemployment duration during the Great Recession. I show that variation in past effort explains this decline. Furthermore, job offers increase subsequent effort. These facts are inconsistent with standard models of search. I introduce a model of sequential search in which workers are uncertain about the offer arrival process and learn through search. Evolving beliefs influence search through two competing channels: the opportunity cost of leisure and the option value of unemployment. Estimation of the model indicates that learning provides a strong account of job search dynamics during the Great Recession.</p>

                                <p>Using a newly created microeconomic archive of US imports at the tariff line level for 1930–1933, we construct industry-level tariff wedges incorporating the input–output structure of US economy and the heterogeneous role of imports across sectors of the economy. We use these wedges to show that the average tariff rate of 46% in 1933 substantially understated the true impact of the Smoot–Hawley (SH) tariff structure, which we estimate to be equivalent to a uniform tariff rate of 70%. We use these wedges to calculate the impact of the Smoot–Hawley tariffs on total factor productivity and welfare. In our benchmark parameterization, we find that tariff protection reduced TFP by 1.2% relative to free trade prior to the Smoot–Hawley legislation. TFP fell by an additional 0.5% between 1930 and 1933 due to Smoot–Hawley. We also conduct counterfactual policy exercises and examine the sensitivity of our results to changes in the elasticity of substitution and the import share. A doubling of the substitution elasticities yields a TFP decline of almost 5% relative to free trade, with an additional reduction due to SH of 0.4%.</p>
